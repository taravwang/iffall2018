				<p><strong>Candy Darling</strong><br> In March 1965, Sedgwick met artist and avant-garde filmmaker Andy Warhol at a party at Lester Persky's apartment. It was far from Warhol to remain unimpressed with the social depth of Sedgwick's background nor with her radiant beauty and she received the suggestion that, with her friend Chuck Wein, she might call in at The Factory, where he always was, his already famed working art studio. During one of her subsequent visits, Warhol was filming Vinyl, his interpretation of the novel A Clockwork Orange. Despite Vinyl's all-male cast, Warhol put Sedgwick in the movie. She also made a small cameo appearance in another Warhol film, Horse, when she entered towards the end of the film. Sedgwick's appearances in both films were brief, but generated enough interest that Warhol decided to create vehicles using her presence to the fullest.</p>
