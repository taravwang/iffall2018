		<p> Warhol superstars were a clique of New York City personalities promoted by Andy Warhol during the 1960s and early 1970s. These personalities appeared in Warhol's artworks and accompanied him in his social life, epitomizing his famous dictum, "In the future everyone will be famous for fifteen minutes". Warhol would simply film them, and declare them "superstars". The superstars would help Warhol generate publicity while Warhol offered fame and attention in return.</p>

	<p>Warhol’s studio, The Factory, played host to most of his superstars and as his experiments in film continued he became more interested in the bohemian eccentrics attracted to the studio. Many of the superstars were celebrated in Lou Reed’s song, Walk on the Wild Side.</p><br>

	<p>Warhol significantly reduced his public accessibility after being shot by Valerie Solanas in 1968. The age of the Warhol superstar soon faded.</p>

	<p>The daughter of real estate investor Carl Bruckenfeld, she married Leonard Holzer, an heir to a New York real estate fortune. Holzer was noted for including art projects in his developments, particularly at the Smith Haven Mall.</p><br>

	<p>Movies she appeared in included Andy Warhol’s Soap Opera (1964), Couch (1964), and Camp (1965), and the independently produced Ciao! Manhattan (1972). She co-produced the 1985 film Kiss of the Spider Woman. Holzer is the subject of “Girl of the Year” in Tom Wolfe’s The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby (1965) and is referenced twice in the 1972 Roxy Music single “Virginia Plain”.</p>

	<p>Nico, was a German singer, songwriter, musician, model, and actress. She had roles in several films, including Federico Fellini’s La Dolce Vita (1960) and Andy Warhol’s Chelsea Girls (1966). When Warhol began managing the Velvet Underground, a New York City quartet consisting of singer/songwriter/guitarist Lou Reed, violist/keyboardist/bassist John Cale, guitarist Sterling Morrison and drummer Maureen Tucker, he proposed that the group take on Nico as a “chanteuse”, an idea to which they consented reluctantly, for both personal and musical reasons.[13][14] The group became the centerpiece of Warhol’s Exploding Plastic Inevitable, a multimedia performance featuring music, lighting, film and dance. Nico sang lead vocals on three songs (“Femme Fatale”, “All Tomorrow’s Parties”, “I’ll Be Your Mirror”), and backing vocal on “Sunday Morning”, on the band’s debut album, The Velvet Underground & Nico (1967).</p>

	<p>Warhol cast Darling in a short comedic scene in Flesh (1968) with Jackie Curtis and Joe Dallesandro. After Flesh, Darling was cast in a central role in Women in Revolt (1971). She played a Long Island socialite, drawn into a woman’s liberation group called P.I.G.S. (Politically Involved Girls) by a character played by Curtis. Interrupted by cast disputes encouraged by Warhol, Women in Revolt took longer to film than Flesh and went through several title changes before it was released. Darling wanted it called “Blonde on a Bum Trip”, since she was the blonde, while Curtis and Woodlawn told her it was more like “Bum on a Blonde Trip”.</p>

	<p>“You care enough, that you want your life to be fulfilled in a living way, not in a painting way, not in a writing way...you really do want it to be involving in living, corresponding with other living objects, moving, changing, that kind of thing.”</p>


	<p>“You live alone, creating your life as you go.”</p>
