	<p> 1. Place rice cakes in hot water for 15-20 minutes while anchovy stock is being made

	<p> 3. Remove fish cakes and allow to cool. Then strain solids from stock and discard.
	<p> 4. Measure 1 cup of stock and place back into 12 inch skillet. Keep remaining stock for future use later.
	<p> 5. Turn heat to medium and add Gochujang, Gochugaru, and sugar. Mix to combine.
	<p> 7. Then add rice cakes and stir frequently for 5 minutes. Sauce will begin to thicken.
	<p> 8. Cut fish cakes into 2x1 inch strips and add to skillet. Gently toss
	<p> 9. Serve with hard boiled egg (optional) and garnish with scallions and sesame seeds.

	<p>As the rice cakes cook, the sauce will thicken. You can always add reserved anchovy stock to liquify the sauce. Otherwise, keep in sealed container and refrigerate for up to 2 weeks.</p>
